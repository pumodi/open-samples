# Kontakt Library Downlad & Setup Guide

### This library requires the FULL Kontakt 5.8.1 or newer. It will not work with the free Kontakt PLAYER. 

These Kontakt Library patches are **not** saved with the samples. In order to use these patches, you will also need to have the samples downloaded from the "Samples" folder located in the parent directory of the selected instrument in the repository. 

Currently these patches lack a GUI, but are mapped with a range of C1-C7. If you desire more range on an instrument, then in Kontakt: 
1. Click the wrench icon in the top left of the loaded library
2. Click "Mapping Editor" if not already visible 
3. Grab the edges of the sample on either side and extend it to the desired note to increase resampled playable range
