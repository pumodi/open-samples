### PCC Recording Engineers - Original Samplists
I would like to thank the following recording engineers:

* Jordan Laurent
* Jay “Dalton” Battin
* Joel Bocek, Lisa Bennett
* Alessandra Genovese
* Michael Romay

For their help with the sampling process. Without their help playing single notes at a time on these instruments, this pack would not have been possible. 
They were the original samplists and recorded the source wavs of the X5DR, M1, K1R, and the JV2080.

### Special Thanks

* PCC Cascade Music & Sonic Arts Department
* Don Thompson, Dan Pettis, & the PCC Cascade Recording Studio team
